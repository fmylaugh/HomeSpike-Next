# @file refresh.sh
# @description Dev-iteration deploy. Syncs the entire app/ tree to
#   /opt/home-spike/ and SIGTERMs the running HomeSpike so the next BFB
#   tap respawns with new code. Does NOT touch Shell.qml or reboot.
#   With DRAWER=1, also pushes the patched Drawer.qml and SIGKILLs
#   Lomiri so the new drawer code loads (you'll see the greeter).
#
# @status Stable.
# @issues SIGKILLing Lomiri logs the user out to the greeter — that's the
#   cost of getting a clean QML reload. Lomiri caches QML aggressively,
#   so a graceful restart doesn't reliably reload changed files.
# @todo None
#
# Usage:  PIN=<phablet-sudo-pin>            ./refresh.sh
#         PIN=<phablet-sudo-pin> DRAWER=1   ./refresh.sh

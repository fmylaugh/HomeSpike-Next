# @file uninstall.sh
# @description Full HomeSpike uninstall. Restores Shell.qml and Drawer.qml
#   from their .orig backups (which install.sh created on first run),
#   removes /opt/home-spike, the .desktop file, and the cross-process
#   inbox. Then reboots. Safe to run even if install never happened —
#   just prints "no backup found" and moves on.
#
# @status Stable.
# @issues Does NOT delete /home/phablet/.config/home-spike/home-spike.conf
#   (your saved layout). If you want a clean wipe, remove it manually.
# @todo None
#
# Usage:  PIN=<phablet-sudo-pin> ./uninstall.sh

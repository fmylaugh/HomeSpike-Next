# @file refresh.sh
# @description Dev-iteration deploy. Syncs the entire app/ tree to
#   /opt/home-spike/ and SIGTERMs the running HomeSpike so the next BFB
#   tap respawns with new code. Default mode touches nothing in /usr/share/.
#
#   With LOMIRI=1, ALSO replaces every Lomiri override file from
#   app/lomiri-overrides/ and SIGKILLs Lomiri so the new shell code
#   loads (you'll see the greeter — unlock to continue).
#
# @status Stable.
# @issues SIGKILLing Lomiri logs the user out to the greeter — that's the
#   cost of getting a clean QML reload. Lomiri caches QML aggressively,
#   so a graceful restart doesn't reliably reload changed files.
# @todo None
#
# Usage:  PIN=<phablet-sudo-pin>            ./refresh.sh
#         PIN=<phablet-sudo-pin> LOMIRI=1   ./refresh.sh
#         (legacy alias: DRAWER=1 also works)
